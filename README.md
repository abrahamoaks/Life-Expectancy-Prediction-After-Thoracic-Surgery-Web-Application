# Life Expectancy Prediction After Thoracic Surgery using Machine Learning with Flask Web App -- Abraham Obianke 

## Introduction 
What is thoracic surgery?
Thoracic surgery includes any operation to treat an issue in your chest and upper abdomen, such as:
Stretched blood vessels (aneurysms),
Congenital (present at birth) heart issues,
Irregular heart rhythms,
Heart failure, and
Coronary artery disease.

## Patients Problem 
### Problem Context
Complication rates following video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for lung cancer range between 6% and 34.2% and the mortality rate ranges between 0.6% and 1.3% (1-3). To date, there is no standardization for their classification. Postoperative complications are directly related to treatment effectiveness, prognosis, hospitalization costs and patientsâ€™ quality of life.

### Analysis Observations 
1. The highest prevalence of Thoracic surgery complications is between the age range of 50 - 70 years
2. The lowest prevalence of Thoracic surgery complications is between the age range of 10 - 30 years
3. The highest contributing clinical feature is False Expiratory Volume (FEV)

## Model Interpretation
 + I implemented explainable AI techniques to understand the decisions made by the machine learning model for individual patients. With this technique, healthcare professionals can gain insights into which features are most influential in predicting the patient's outcome (i.e., survival or death).

## Model Evaluation Metrics
Since this is a binary classification problem, I used the following metrics:
* **Confusion matrix** - For getting a better clarity of the number of correct/incorrect predictions made by the model.
* **Classification report** - For providing insights into the model's performance.
* **Accuracy score** - To evaluate the overall performance of the classification model.

## Data-Driven Solution 
  ### Deploying the Model with a Flask Web App
 + To make the model accessible to end-users, I have developed a full fledged web application which provides a friendly user interface where users can input relevant parameters through a web form. Upon submission, the app processes the input data using the accurately trained cloud based machine learning model and provides the predicted outcome of a patient.

## Model Monitoring and Maintenance 
- I leveraged CometML, a robust model monitoring platform and implemented a quality control check, experiment tracking, and model monitoring techniques to observe data drift, conduct routine maintenance and prevent performance degradation. This is to help ensure model fairness, improve model performance and maintain model reliability.

### Key Achievement(s)
 + Model achieved an overall performance accuracy of >85% using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Machine Learning Algorithm.
 + Model operationalized and deployed on cloud premises for easy accessibility.
 + Model successfully logged for continuous monitoring and routine maintenance.
